# Suduko
A Suduko generator

This project was attempted multiple times when I was learning programming.

It is a one which at first seems simple, but when you start you quickly
get to difficulties. This project was interesting, I learned a lot 
about making sure te suduko was solvable and how to generate them 
efficiently.
